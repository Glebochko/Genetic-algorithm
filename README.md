Technology stack
---
- Python3
- Library Graphics

Preparation for work - installation library graphics
---
- Clone project :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Glebochko/Genetic-algorithm.git
```
- For convenience, it is better to make a virtual environment :
```bash
python3 -m venv graphics_genalg_venv
. graphics_genalg_venv/bin/activate
```
- Now download the graphics library :
```bash
pip3 install http://bit.ly/csc161graphics
```
- Go to development branch for development :
```bash
cd Genetic-algorithm
git checkout development
```

Bugs
